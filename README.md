## Can of Books

**Author**: Amy Pierce, Jordan Yamada, Rhea Carillo
**Version**: 1.0.0 

## Overview
This is the backend for the Can of Books project we are doing for week 3 of class 301

## Getting Started

In order to build this app, the user will need to first clone the template Can-Of-Books-Backend-Template from the Codefellows repository. Then the user will need to add any collaborators to the new repo, add a .gitignore file and make sure that .env is included in that file, add a .env file using the sample .env file that is included in this project (and it's good practice to include a .env.sample file as well), include a linter file if desired, and update the README to explain who is implementing the project and any details you feel are necessary. After cloning the repo, users will need to use npm to install all of the depencies listed in the architecture section, as well as Node Mon, if it is not already installed. This project will also require a front end.

## Architecture
This application uses Javascript, NodeJS, Express, Axios, Cors, MongoDB, Mongoose, dotenv [ARE THERE MORE?] and is the back end control for a database of book information. 

## Change Log
8/29/2022 5:45pm - Application is now a functioning server with a GET route to retrieve information from the database.

## Credit and Collaborations
Thanks to Sheyna Watkins, [other people or resources that helped]

What hours will you be available to communicate?

All team members will be available from 9am-6pm and additional hours as negotiated.

What platform will you use to communicate (ie. Slack, phone …)?

Slack and in person.

How often will you take breaks?

We are going to try to employ a 50-10 pomodoro strategy.

What is your plan if you start to fall behind?

Fail. (Jordan disagrees so we are negotiating this point.)

Cooperative

Make a list of each parson’s strengths.

Rhea is good at debugging, analyzing, and commenting. Jordan is good at debugging, analyzing and creative problem solving. Amy is good at time management, breaking and fixing code and wearing purple.

How can you best utilize these strengths in the development of your application?

Seriouslyly we agree that we're all tired of these questions.

In what areas do you each want to develop greater strength?

Amy wants to get better at writing dry code and using built in functions, Jordan wants to get better at intial project implementation, Rhea wants to get better at assertiveness. 

Knowing that every person in your team needs to understand the code, how do you plan to approach the day-to-day development?

Very carefully. We will pair program, discuss any code a member doesn't understand, and check in on each other's progress as needed.

Conflict Resolution

What will your team do if one person is pulling all the weight while the other person is not contributing?

Muay Thai.


What will your team do if one person is taking over the project and not letting the other member contribute?

Muy Thai.

How will you approach each other and the challenge of building an application knowing that it is impossible for two people to be at the exact same place in understanding and skill level?

Everyone has strengths and weaknesses. We will be respectful of each other's learning processes. And...

Muy Thai.
