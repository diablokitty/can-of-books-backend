## Can of Books

**Author**: Amy Pierce, Jordan Yamada, Rhea Carillo
**Version**: 1.0.0 

## Overview
This is the backend for the Can of Books project we are doing for week 3 of class 301

## Getting Started

In order to build this app, the user will need to first clone the template Can-Of-Books-Backend-Template from the Codefellows repository. Then the user will need to add any collaborators to the new repo, add a .gitignore file and make sure that .env is included in that file, add a .env file using the sample .env file that is included in this project (and it's good practice to include a .env.sample file as well), include a linter file if desired, and update the README to explain who is implementing the project and any details you feel are necessary. After cloning the repo, users will need to use npm to install all of the depencies listed in the architecture section, as well as Node Mon, if it is not already installed. This project will also require a front end.

## Architecture
This application uses Javascript, NodeJS, Express, Axios, Cors, MongoDB, Mongoose, dotenv [ARE THERE MORE?] and is the back end control for a database of book information.
